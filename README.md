# hello-world
My first repository

I'm an RIT alumni and RIT made it to the sweet 16 D1 hockey tournament.  I like watching hockey but I cannot play.  I don't know how to skate. I have 4 brothers and sisters so my family is rather large.  My favorite flower is the lilac for it's fragrance.  My favorite bouquet flower is the tulip.
